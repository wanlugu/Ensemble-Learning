Introduction to Bayesian Optimization <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nWe have found the best machine learning model for a kaggle competition. Now, we try to improve our model by tuning  its hyperparameters. There are standard hyperparameter optimization techniques like GridSearch and RandomSearch. But these techniques search the full space of available parameter values. If we have small set of parameter values, then this is Ok. But with large parameter spaces, this is quite time-consuming and obviously frustrating.\n\nA popular alternative to tune the model hyperparameters is **Bayesian Optimization**. Bayesian Optimization is a probabilistic model-based technique used to find minimum of any function. This approach can yield better performance on the test set while it requires fewer iterations than random search. It takes into account\npast evaluations when choosing the optimal set of hyperparameters. Thus it chooses its parameter combinations in an informed way. In doing so, it focus on those parameters that yield the best possible scores. Thus, this technique requires less number of iterations to find the optimal set of parameter values. It ignores those areas of the parameter space that are useless. Hence, it is less time-consuming and not frustrating at all. \n\nPlease visit the following link for more information on Bayesian Optimization.\n\nhttps://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Bayesian Optimization Method <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\nBayesian optimization is also called **Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO)**. It finds the value that minimizes an objective function by building a surrogate function. A surrogate function is nothing but a probability model based on past evaluation results of the objective. In the surrogate function, the input values to be evaluated are selected based on the criteria of expected improvement. Bayesian methods use past evaluation results to choose the next input values. So, this method excludes the poor input values and limit the evaluation of the objective function by choosing the next input values which have done well in the past.\n\nNowadays, there are a number of Python libraries that enable us to implement Bayesian Optimization for machine learning models. The examples of libraries are Spearmint, Hyperopt or SMAC. Scikit-learn also provides a library named **Scikit-optimize** for Bayesian optimization.\n\nBayesian Optimization methods differ in how they construct the surrogate function. Spearmint uses Gaussian Process surrogate while SMAC uses Random Forest Regression. Hyperopt uses the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) for optimization. \n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

Objective function**\n\nThe objective function can be any function which returns a real value that we want to minimize. In this case, we want to minimize the validation error of a machine learning model with respect to the hyperparameters. If the real value is accuracy, then we want to maximize it. Then the function should return the negative of that metric. \n\n**2. Domain space**\n\nThe domain space is the input values over which we want to search.\n\n**3.

Conclusion <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"7\"></a>\n\n[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In this kernel, I demonstrated the idea of Bayesian Optimisation by using Hyperopt.\n\n- Bayesian optimisation chooses the next hyperparameters in an informed way, and as such spends more time evaluating areas of the parameter distribution it believes have the highest chance of bringing a cross-validation score improvement versus previous iterations.\n\n- This can result in fewer evaluations of the objective function and better generalisation performance on the test set compared to random or grid search.\n\n- The relative benefits of Bayesian Optimisation differ with the number of dimensions of the dataset and the size of the parameter grid. The larger the dataset and or the parameter grid, the higher the potential for efficacy gains.\n\n- Random Search can still outperform Bayesian Optimisation as it could bump onto the optimal set of hyperparameters right at the start — just by luck."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I hope you find this kernel useful and enjoyable.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Your comments and feedback are most welcome."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[Go to Top](#0)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
